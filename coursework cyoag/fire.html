      <p>
        after about what you think is half an hour you have managed to find
        enough dry wood and leaves to create a small fire to get some warmth
        whilst you rest <br />

        you start to remove the skin of the dog like creature and put it on the
        stick and put it over the fire to cook <br />

        after a short while you start to hear lots of movement in the close
        proximity to your make shift camp site you pick up your plank of wood
        from the ship and stand to have a look<br />

        you have seen that there are a whole pack of them dog like creature
        surrounding the make shift camp you close your eyes as you know that you
        will not be able to take all them on.
        <br />but after what feels like a long time and you havnt felt anything
        you open them and they are all dead and a group of men are standing in
        front of you <br />they offer some dry cloths and food as they say they
        had seen smoke raising from the forrest and came to investagate <br />
        you tell them about the ship that you where on and that i got destroyed
        in the recent storm that happened <br />they offer to take you to their
        small town
